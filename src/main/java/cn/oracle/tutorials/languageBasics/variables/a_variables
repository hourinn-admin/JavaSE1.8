The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables
	.Instance Variables(Non-Static Fields)
	.Class Variables(Static Fields)
	.Local Variables - a method will often store its temporary state in local variables.
	.Parameters

The rules and conventions for naming variables:
	. A variable's name can be any legal identifier â€” an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits
	. The convention is to always begin your variable names with a letter,not "$" or "_".
		Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. 
	.Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters.
	.use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations,make your code easier to read and understand.
	.keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.
	.If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters.
	 	If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word
	.If your variable stores a constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6
		the convention,capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. 
		By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere.
