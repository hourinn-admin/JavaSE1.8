A method returns to the code that invoked it when it
	1.completes all the statements in the method,
	2.reaches a return statement, or
	3.throws an exception (covered later)
	
	*Any method declared void doesn't return a value. It does not need to contain a return statement, but it may do so.  like this:
		return;

		
Returning a Class or Interface
	*the returned object could be a subclass of the return type
	*You also can use interface names as return types. In this case, the object returned must implement the specified interface.
