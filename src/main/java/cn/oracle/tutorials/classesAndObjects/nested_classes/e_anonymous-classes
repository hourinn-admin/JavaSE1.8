1.The Anonymous Class Expression consists of the following:

	●The new operator
	●The name of an interface to implement or a class to extend.
	●Parentheses that contain the arguments to a constructor ,just like a normal class instance creation expression
		when you implement an interface,there is no constructor,so you use an empty pair of parentheses.
	●A body ,which is a class declaration body ,More specifically ,in the body ,statements are not allowed

2.Accessing Local Variables of the Enclosing scope
	
	●An anonymous class has access to the members of its enclosing class
	●An anonymous class cannot access local variables in its enclosing scope that are not declared as final or effectively final.(anonymous classes can capture variables)
	●Like a nested class,a declaration of a type in an anonymous class shadows any other declarations in the enclosing scope that have the same name.
	
3. The restrictions of Anonymous classes with respect to their members

	●you cannot declare static initializers or members interfaces in an anonymous classes
	●An anonymous class can have static members provided that they are constant variables
	
4.What you can declare in annoymous classes
	
	●Fields
	●Extra methods
	●Instance initializers
	●local classes
