1.Static Nested Classes

	●As with class methods and variables, a static nested class is associated with its outer class
		And like static class methods, a static nested class cannot refer directly to instance variables or methods defined in its enclosing class: 
	●Static nested classes are accessed using the enclosing class name: OuterClass.StaticNestedClass
	●a static nested class is behaviorally a top-level class that has been nested in another top-level class for packaging convenience.
	●static nested class can used in an interface to create some common logic.
