Creating Objects and assigns it to a variable,Each of these statements has three parts:
	1.Declaration: The code set in bold are all variable declarations that associate a variable name with an object type.
	2.Instantiation: The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object.
	3.Initialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.

1.Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Object
	After declaration,just declaring a reference,you mush assign an object to it before use it .otherwise,you will get a compiler error.

2.Instantiating a Class
	The new operator instantiates a class(creating an object.) by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory. The new operator also invokes the object constructor.
	The new operator returns a reference to the object it created. This reference is usually assigned to a variable of the appropriate type
	The reference returned by the new operator does not have to be assigned to a variable. It can also be used directly in an expression. For example:
		int height = new Rectangle().height;

3.Initializing an Object
	an object can have multiple references to it.
