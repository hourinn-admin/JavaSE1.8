There are several kinds of variables:
	1.Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
	2.Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
	3.Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.
	
Field declarations are composed of three components, in order:
	1.Zero or more modifiers, such as public or private.
	2.The field's type.
	3.The field's name.
