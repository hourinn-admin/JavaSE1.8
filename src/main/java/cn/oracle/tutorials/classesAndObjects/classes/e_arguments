1.Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method or constructor declaration. Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. 
	When you invoke a method, the arguments used must match the declaration's parameters in type and order.		

2.varargs(...)
	You use varargs when you don't know how many of a particular type of argument will be passed to the method
	
3.Passing Primitive Data Type Arguments
	Primitive arguments, such as an int or a double, are passed into methods by value
 	This means that any changes to the values of the parameters exist only within the scope of the method. When the method returns, 
 	the parameters are gone and any changes to them are lost
 	
4.Passing Reference Data Type Arguments
		Reference data type parameters, such as objects, are also passed into methods by value. 
		This means that when the method returns, the passed-in reference still references the same object as before. 
		However, the values of the object's fields can be changed in the method, if they have the proper access level.
