	Defining an interface which can compare the "size" of similar objects instantiated from the classes that implement the interface
	For strings ,it could be number of characters;for book ,it could be number of pages;for person ,it could be age;for planer geometric objects,area 
	would be a good choice,while volume would be work for three-dimensional geometric objects;
