1.Polymorphism
	●Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.
	
	※The Java virtual machine (JVM) calls the appropriate method for the object that is referred to in each variable. It does not call the method that is defined by the variable's type. 
	This behavior is referred to as virtual method invocation and demonstrates an aspect of the important polymorphism features in the Java language.
