1.The Interface type

	●when classes implement an interface ,the objects instantiated from these classes,no matter what their class inheritance is ,they can be of both their own class(or supperclass) type 
		and the interface type.
	●the multiple inheritance that extend a supperclass or implement an interface can give them some of the advantages where they can have behavior from both a supperclass and an interface.
