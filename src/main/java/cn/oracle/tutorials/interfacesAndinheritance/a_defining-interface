1.Defining the interface

	modifiers:
	
		●The specifier of interface :  public(can be used by any class in any package) , not public (accessed by  the classes defined in the same package as the interface)
		●An interface can extend other interfaces

	interface body:
		
		●the interface body can contain abstract methods ,default methods ,static methods ,and all are implicitly public ,so you can omit the public modifier,for abstract methods ,also you 
			can omit the abstract modifier
		●in addition ,an interface can contain constant declarations,all constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public ,static,final ,so you can omit these modifiers
